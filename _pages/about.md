👨‍🎓 **Student Life:**
I'm a third-year undergraduate student at Kyrgyz State Technical University named after I. Razzakov. Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Machine Learning and Data Science with GPA: 3.94/4.0.

🔬 **Research Focus:**
As a dedicated researcher, I specialize in super-resolution and low-level vision tasks. Currently, I'm working on hybrid models combining Mamba and Transformers to push the boundaries of what's possible in image enhancement. It's a collaboration work with an awesome scientist, [Zheng Chen](https://zhengchen1999.github.io/).

📘 **Author in Progress:**
I'm writing a book titled "Computer Vision with Neural Networks: from Zero to Hero." My goal is to bridge the gap between beginners and professionals, making this fascinating topic accessible to all and providing new insights to seasoned experts.

🇨🇭 **Professional Work:**
I work for a Swiss company and am the lead author of a Super-Resolution algorithm for satellite images. You can check out my work at [earthtodate.com](https://earthtodate.com).

🎓 **Educational Contributions:**
I conduct a series of advanced training lectures on Computer Vision at my university and other private companies, sharing my knowledge and passion with others.

🔍 **Research Interests:**
My main scientific interests include super-resolution, image quality enhancement, image generation, and particularly various innovations in the architecture and design of neural networks.

👨‍🔬 **Research Aspirations:**
I'm highly motivated and eager to join a research group or find a professor with whom I can collaborate to make new discoveries. I'm always looking for opportunities to contribute and learn.

🎮 **Fun Facts:**

- **Minesweeper Master:** My personal best for solving a medium-level Minesweeper (16x16, 40 mines) is 26 seconds.
- **Top player in mobile game:** I rank in the top 500 among 1M+ players in F-Adventurer.
- **Manga/Manhwa maniac:** I read over 20k+ chapters of manga/manhwa.
